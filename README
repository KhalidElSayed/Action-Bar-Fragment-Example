This project was hacked together from various examples of fragments that I've found laying around the web. I needed something that I could reference and extend easily, using a straightforward framework. I think that I've delivered that here. If you've read up on Fragments, what's going on here should make some sense. 

Requires ActionBarSherlock (v3.5.1) library to provide an action bar to any android 2.1 and up. Get library here - http://actionbarsherlock.com
